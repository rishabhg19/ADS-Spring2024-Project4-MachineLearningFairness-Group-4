+ Project summary: In this project, we use algorithms to improve the fairness of machine learning classifiers on a Compas dataset about recidivism. This dataset is known to be unfair, so machine learning projects involving this dataset benefit from using algorithms that improve fair classification. The first algorithm we look at is classification without disparate mistreatment. Here, we implement the algorithm so that the output of the classifier mitigates disparate impact and mistreatment, making the results more fair. The second algorithm we look at is a fairness aware classifier with a prejudice remover regularizer. Here, we implement the algorithm that is aware of its own fairness...
